## introduction 

It is very important to know what ingredients form the Computer as a Programmer.
  
Many people think that Computer Architecture is not worthy to spend many times to study it. <br />
As technology advances rapidly, it is true that deep study of computer hardware has become a choice, not a necessity, and that it seems there is no adequate reason to learn. <br />

Memory Management, which was destined for former programmers, is now obsolete because all those things are performed by "Garbage Collectors" which is almost every modern programming language provide.

And optimization for the better performance of software is not as important as it was about 10 years ago. <br />
Nowadays, ability to optimize _code_ is not that important, but the ability to collaborate with others <br />
like writing code with good readability (obviously understandable code as if junior developers can understand).<br />

However the reason that we should learn how computers work and what things inside in that machine is that <br />
Even though there are many of reasons you do not have to study hardware, there are still many things you can't do if you don't know the machine in many fields such as Graphics, Network, Embeded and so on.. <br /> 

This is the reason why every CS<sup>(__C__omputer __S__ciecne)</sup> program offers CA<sup>(__C__umputer __A__rchitecture)</sup> in the first semester.

Let's take the first step towards the machine that is indispensable to modern people.

<hr />

Computers are nothing but scrap metal, excepts for gates, compared to the perception that they are complex.<br />
Every calculations are performed by combination of gates and a tiny bit of electricity.<br />

I know that sounds ridiculous..<br />
Let's think about that after reading this writing.

<hr />

## NAND Gate

Let's get to know what is inside in this simple machine with __NAND__ gate.

![NAND Gate](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/NAND_ANSI_Labelled.svg/180px-NAND_ANSI_Labelled.svg.png)

As you can see the little diagram above, that picture shows us how NAND gate looks like.<br />

There are two inputs called A and B and an output Q.<br />
Short lines which connected to all inputs and output are called wires or bits. All bits store two states, on and off.<br />

NAND gate take two inputs and produce an output according to its own function.<br />

At this point, Truth Table will be useful to understand how the various input combinations create the output, like blow:

###### <sup>0 stands for off and 1 stands for on.</sup>

The table indicates that the output is off when only both inputs are on. This is how NAND gate sets the output. Some of you guys are probably familiar with &&(AND) which is very useful expression in conditional or repetitive statement in programming language. And as you can realize at this moment, NAND gate performs exactly the opposite function of &&(AND) operator.

<hr />

## NOT Gate

We can make similar but different gate by tying the inputs from __NAND__ gate which called __NOT__ gate, like this:<br />
![NOT Gate](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/NOT_from_NAND.svg/180px-NOT_from_NAND.svg.png)
&emsp;__&rightarrow;__&emsp;
![NOT Gate](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/NOT_ANSI_Labelled.svg/180px-NOT_ANSI_Labelled.svg.png)

There are only one ouput unlike __NAND__ gate that we've been looking at. If the A<sup>input</sup> is on, then Q<sup>output</sup> will be off. __NOT__ gate will always print the opposite of the input.

The truth table is down blow:<br />

At first glance, you may think this NOT gate is unnecessary, but it plays an important role in making the next gate.

<hr />

## AND Gate

Now it is time to combine those two gates we've come up with.<br />
This combination of gates may seem like magical thing that you have never imagined.

We can take the output that came out from the __NAND__ gate and put that result in __NOT__ gate.<br /> It is available because __NOT__ gate needs only one input to perform their process.<br />
Let's take a look at how this combination is organized:<br />

![AND Gate](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/AND_from_NAND.svg/300px-AND_from_NAND.svg.png)<br />

If both inputs are on, then the middle output will be off because left side gate is __NAND__ gate. Then the result becomes an input of the right side gate which is __NOT__ gate, so the result will be on. So the result is on when both inputs are on.

Truth table will help you to understand this gate:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/vRU0uPC.png" alt="AND table" style="width: 250px;"></img>

We call this combined gate as __AND__ gate. <br />
This __AND__ gate, however, is used so often in computer. So we can built these two gate as a single unit like this: <br />

![AND Gate](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/AND_ANSI_Labelled.svg/180px-AND_ANSI_Labelled.svg.png)

The only thing the difference between __NAND__ and __AND__ gate is the little 'O' sign that attached to the BIG 'D' sign. Now it has become obvious that the little 'O' sign represents "opposite".

Then you can have simpler Truth Table:<br />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cz3v8vd.png" alt="AND table" style="width: 200px;"></img>

I am sure that you guys already have some programming experience, so this __AND__ gate is the most understandable gate among we've ever dealt with.
