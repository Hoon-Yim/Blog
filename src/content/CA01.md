## introduction 

It is very important to know what ingredients form the Computer as a Programmer.
  
Many people think that Computer Architecture is not worthy to spend many times to study it. <br />
As technology advances rapidly, it is true that deep study of computer hardware has become a choice, not a necessity, and that it seems there is no adequate reason to learn. <br />

Because Memory Management is useless because all those things done by "Garbage Collecter" which is almost every modern programming language provide. <br />

Computer is just a tons of _gates_ but nothing. <br />
